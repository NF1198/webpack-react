# Webpack + React + sass Seed

The master branch just contains a very simple seed for 
building a website with webpack, react and sass.

## Scripts in package.json

* `start`: Start the webpack-dev-server
* `build:dist`: Build a complete distribution
* `clean:dist`: Clean the distribution
* `server:production`: start a web server in the `dist` folder

## Initial setup

Run `npm install` to install dependencies. You'll also 
need __typescript__ and __webpack__ (`npm install -g typescript webpack').
